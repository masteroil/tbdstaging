											<p>Our butchers weigh and prepare the meat, organs, vegetables and superfoods, removing excess fat and bone. They place all the ingredients onto a big mixing machine which produces a chunky blend. Because we have nothing to hide and we like you to see the quality of the ingredients we use, we don't mince the mixture into a fine mush. This chunky mixture is frozen and hand cut into 250g discs.</p>
											<p>Our varieties are made in small batches, in a HACCP approved human food production facility.</p>

The raw unfrozen pet foods you see at the supermarket with a long shelf life, usually undergo this process.</p>

											<p>The convenience of our 250g meal portions (discs) is one of the things our customers say they really like. They don't need to thaw out a large amount of food at a time, there is no wastage. We’re mindful of using as little packaging as possible, so we don't individually wrap each portion. Simply remove what you need from our resealable bag and return to the freezer.</p>

											<p>Transitioning to raw dog food is easy, but a gradual transition is an important element in changing to a raw diet.</p>
											<p>We suggest you start by mixing your existing food with a portion of our raw food. Over a period of 7-10  days, gradually decrease the kibble and increase the raw portion.</p>
											<p>Start with the milder chicken or turkey varieties and stay with these until your dog's poop is well formed. Then gradually introduce new proteins. If your dog is a little fussy, then try mixing the existing variety with some of the new variety.</p>
											<p>Try following this plan:</p>

										<p>The following products help with a smooth transition:</p>
										<ul>
										   <li><b>Gut Soothe</b> is as the name suggests -  gentle on tummies and is a fantastic first aid product for dogs and puppies suffering from diarrhea or vomiting. It contains slippery elm, aloe and marshmallow root which are all very soothing on the digestive system.</li>
										   <li><b>Healthy Gut</b> is wonderful for dogs who have been eating kibble their whole lives and/or have had poor nutrition such as rescue dogs or chronically sick dogs who require a dramatic boost in their nutrient absorption rate. It contains digestive enzymes to aid in the absorption of nutrients.</li>

										<p><b>Adult Dog:</b> A general rule for an adult dog is to calculate 2.5% of your Adult dog's weight and feed this amount daily. You may want to split this over two meals.</p>
										<p>For example: Feed a 10kg dog one disc daily (250g)</p>
										<p><b>Puppy:</b> Puppies need considerably higher as they are growing and developing. Feed between 6-9% of your puppy's current body weight, spread over several meals per day ( depending on their age)</p>
										<p>For example: Feed a 10kg puppy aged 2-4 months old 4 discs per day (1kg).</p>

											<p>You should feed as many different proteins as possible. Like a good marriage, variety is the spice of life and will help your dog keep their diet  balanced and interesting over time. And they’ll love you for it.</p>
											<p>As with humans each and every meal does not need to be completely balanced. However, feeding a variety of protein sources is a key factor in feeding a raw food diet. Some pets are limited through allergies to certain proteins. Kangaroo is a great choice for dogs with allergies.</p>

											<p>Raw meat is a species appropriate diet for dogs, just like gum leaves are for Koalas. These species can’t survive being fed a diet they haven’t evolved to eat. Dogs are designed to eat meat and while they are very adaptive and can eat other foods, they don't thrive and stay healthy long term.</p>
											<p>All our ingredients are <b>human grade</b>. All meat, organs and bones come from the same place your local butchers sources his ingredients. Meat that is destined for human consumption or export undergoes very strict inspection, health and safety practices which is why we ONLY use human grade - never pet grade or rendered meats.</p>
											<p>The stomach acid has a PH of 1-2, very acidic, killing any bacteria present. Their digestion of meat is very quick, so any bacteria will not get a chance to take hold. Handle your dog's meat meals just as you would your own meat. Keep it frozen and thaw in the refrigerator. Maintain healthy food handling practices, wash their bowls and dishes after feeding. Wash your hands before and after handling meat. It really is just common sense.</p>

											<p>Meat by nature is about 60% moisture so it is natural your dog will not be desperately trying to quench their thirst as it would after eating a bowl of dry kibble. This also means the chance of kidney and bladder problems will be reduced, as your pet will be flushing out their systems with the water that is naturally in their food. Kibble fed dogs need to drink a lot more water just to process their food.</p>
